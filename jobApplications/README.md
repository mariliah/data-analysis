# Job Applications

In this project, I am teaching myself skills for data analytics using the amount of job applications I submit. <br>

I will be tracking: company, job titles, salary, YOE, platform where I submitted the application, whether I used a customized resume, submitted a cover letter, date of application, date of response, interviews, and if there are any offers I have received.
These fields may change as I start my search<br>

I will be using Excel for data input. Other tools I will be using to do data analysis: Microsoft Access, Microsoft SQL server, SQL, Python (in Excel), R for visualization.
